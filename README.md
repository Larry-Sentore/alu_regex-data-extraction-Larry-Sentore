Welcome to my regex program

OVERVIEW

The program uses regex to identify certain patterns in text.
The patterns include emails, phone numbers, hashtags, and credit card numbers aswell. 
The program itself takes text from the sample.txt file and then uses the re module functions to extract the above mentionned patterns. 

SETUP

As previously mentionned, the app requires data from the sample.txt file in order to work. 
To edit the sample text, delete the content currently present in the file and copy in your own bit of text. After that, save the file.
Running the program is as simple as running the regexcode.py file. The program will then print out the extracted patterns to the console.
