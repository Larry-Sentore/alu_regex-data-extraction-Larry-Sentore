Hey team,

Just wanted to kick off our sprint with some updates and reminders. First, please reach out to our new UX lead at maria.garcia@designhub.co.uk if you need wireframes or style guides—she’s also reachable via phone at (415) 555-0198 or 415-555-0199. If you run into any backend deployment issues, ping devops@cloudworks.io or shoot them a text at 212-555-0123. For anything urgent after hours, you can also try 212.555.0145.

Reminder: our conference call with the GDPR compliance auditors is scheduled for 2:30 PM on Thursday—dial in at +1 (800) 123-4567 and use access code 334455. Also, don’t forget to file your expense reports by Friday. A few folks have already submitted receipts, charged to card number 1234 5678 9012 3456; if yours ends in 7890 (e.g. 9876-5432-1098-7890), please double-check that you masked the full number before sending.

On the marketing side, the new #SpringSale campaign is live—use hashtag #SpringSavings and #ALUDevPromo when sharing on socials. We’ve seen great traction on #100DaysOfCode and #DevLife posts already. Shout-out to @jordan_dev for that amazing testimonial video!

Finally, for those ordering office supplies, remember to use the corporate card—last four digits 4567—at checkout, and forward the confirmation to supplies@alu-corp.com. If you encounter any payment gateway errors, contact our billing partner at 800-999-8888 or billing.support@payflow.org.

Cheers,  
The ALU DevOps Team
